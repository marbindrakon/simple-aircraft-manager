Oil & Fuel Tracking
===================

The Oil and Fuel tabs track consumable usage over time and display trend charts
to help identify consumption patterns.

Oil Tab
-------

The Oil tab tracks oil additions and consumption.

Adding an Oil Record
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Click **Add Oil Record** (owners and pilots).
2. Fill in:

   - **Date** -- When the oil was added.
   - **Flight Hours** -- Aircraft hours at the time.
   - **Quantity Added** -- Amount of oil added in quarts.
   - **Level After** -- Oil level after adding (optional).
   - **Type** -- The oil brand/type used (optional).
   - **Notes** -- Any additional details (optional).

3. Click **Save**.

Oil Consumption Chart
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When you have two or more oil records, a **trend chart** appears showing oil
consumption over time in **hours per quart**. This helps you monitor engine
health -- increasing oil consumption can indicate wear.

The chart plots each data point against flight hours so you can spot trends
over the life of the engine.

Oil Records Table
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Below the chart, a table lists all oil records with date, hours, quantity,
level after, type, and notes. Owners can click the **pencil** icon to edit a
record.

Fuel Tab
--------

The Fuel tab works identically to the Oil tab but tracks fuel consumption.

Adding a Fuel Record
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Click **Add Fuel Record** (owners and pilots).
2. Fill in:

   - **Date** -- When you refueled.
   - **Flight Hours** -- Aircraft hours at the time.
   - **Quantity Added** -- Amount of fuel added in gallons.
   - **Level After** -- Fuel level after refueling (optional).
   - **Type** -- The fuel grade (e.g., 100LL) (optional).
   - **Notes** -- Any additional details (optional).

3. Click **Save**.

Fuel Consumption Chart
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

With two or more records, a trend chart displays fuel burn rate in **gallons
per hour**. This helps verify that fuel consumption is within expected
parameters for your engine and flight profile.
